This package is older, and with the actual react-native version, the app crashes. It's installation is made in native's android environment. Take a look at [android's]('https://github.com/lucasGabrielDeAA/react-native-instagram-share/tree/master/android/app/src/main/java/com') directory, if you want to replicate this behavior.
